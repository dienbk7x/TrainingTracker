# Intro #

__TrainingTracker__ is a Rails app designed to aid small companies to track employee training.  It allows someone to track who has been trained to what documents and when they are due to be re-trained.  It is a very simple app designed to eliminate the waste and time associated with maintaining a spreadsheet of the data.
